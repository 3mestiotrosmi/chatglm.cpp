If you have purchased Finale 25, the latest version of the world-renowned music notation software, you will need a serial number to activate and use it. A serial number is a unique code that identifies your license and allows you to install and run Finale 25 on your computer. A Finale 25 serial number has a format of four letters followed by a hyphen and then 6 to 8 alphanumeric characters (note that some serial numbers may be only numbers). For example: XXXX-123456, XXXX-1A2B3C4D.
