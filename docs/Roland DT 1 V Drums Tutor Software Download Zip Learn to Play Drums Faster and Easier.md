In this article, we will show you how to download, install and use the Roland DT-1 V-Drums Tutor software. You will need a Roland V-Drums kit, a computer, a MIDI or USB cable, and a drum monitor or headphones. Let's get started!
 
## How to Download the Roland DT-1 V-Drums Tutor Software
 
The first step is to download the Roland DT-1 V-Drums Tutor software from the official Roland website. You can find it here: [https://www.roland.com/global/products/dt-1/](https://www.roland.com/global/products/dt-1/). You will need to register your product and create an account to access the download link. Once you have downloaded the software, you will need to unzip the file and run the installer. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation process.
 
## How to Connect Your Roland V-Drums Kit to Your Computer
 
The next step is to connect your Roland V-Drums kit to your computer using a MIDI or USB cable. Depending on your drum module, you may need a MIDI interface (such as the UM-ONE MK2) or a USB driver (such as the TD-17 driver) to make the connection. You can find more information on how to connect your specific drum module here: [https://www.roland.com/ca/products/dt-1/downloads/](https://www.roland.com/ca/products/dt-1/downloads/). Once you have connected your drum kit to your computer, launch the DT-1 software and select your device from the settings menu.
 
If you want to hear the sound of your drums through your computer speakers or headphones, you will need to connect your drum module to your computer using a 3.5mm headphone cable. Alternatively, you can use a drum monitor (such as the PM series) or headphones connected directly to your drum module.
 
## How to Use the Roland DT-1 V-Drums Tutor Software
 
Once you have set up everything, you are ready to use the Roland DT-1 V-Drums Tutor software. The software has two main screens: notation and game. The notation screen shows you the drum notation of each exercise, pattern or song, along with a bouncing ball that indicates the tempo. The game screen shows you blocks that scroll down at the timing of each note, similar to a video game. You can switch between the two screens by clicking on the icons at the top right corner of the screen.
