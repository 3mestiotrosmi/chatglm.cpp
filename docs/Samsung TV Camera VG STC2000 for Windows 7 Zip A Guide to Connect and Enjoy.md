If you have a Samsung TV Camera VG-STC2000 and want to use it on your Windows 7 computer, you may have some trouble finding the right driver. The Samsung TV Camera VG-STC2000 is designed to work with Samsung Smart TVs, but it can also be used as a webcam on your PC with some tweaks.

1. Download the driver file from [this link](https://soundcloud.com/amy-hoehns/samsung-tv-camera-vg-stc2000-driver-for-windows-7) [^2^]. It is a zip file that contains an exe, inf, zip, and sys file.
2. Extract the zip file to a folder on your computer.
3. Go to Device Manager and find the Samsung TV Camera VG-STC2000 under Imaging Devices. If you don't see it, you may need to plug it in first.
4. Right-click on the device and select Update Driver Software.
5. Select Browse my computer for driver software and navigate to the folder where you extracted the zip file.
6. Select the inf file and click Next.
7. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. You may need to restart your computer.

Now you should be able to use your Samsung TV Camera VG-STC2000 as a webcam on your Windows 7 PC. You can test it with Skype, Zoom, or any other video chat application. You can also enjoy a video call or workout to Samsung Health with the Slim Fit Camera that transmits 30 frames per second in 1080p [^1^].

The Samsung TV Camera VG-STC2000 is a slim and sleek device that can be easily attached to your Samsung Smart TV with a magnet. It has a built-in microphone and a lens cover for privacy. You can adjust the angle of the camera to suit your viewing position.
 
Many users have praised the Samsung TV Camera VG-STC2000 for its high-quality video and audio, easy setup, and compatibility with various apps. One user wrote on Amazon [^1^]: "Now I have this camera, the TV is hardwired into the cable box and works first time, every time. Setup is incredibly easy (just dont forget to open the lens cover first!) Its great being able to sit on the sofa and have a conversation with my whole family (and cats) in shot."
 
However, some users have also reported some drawbacks of the Samsung TV Camera VG-STC2000, such as its high price, limited availability, and lack of support for newer Samsung TVs. Some users also complained about the camera not working well in low-light conditions or with certain apps. Therefore, before buying this camera, you should check if it is compatible with your Samsung TV model and your preferred video chat app.
  
If you are looking for an alternative to the Samsung TV Camera VG-STC2000, you may have a hard time finding one that works with your Samsung Smart TV. According to some sources [^2^] [^3^], the VG-STC family of cameras were custom-designed for Samsung TVs only, and there is no official driver for Windows or Linux. You may be able to find some unofficial drivers online, but they may not work well or at all.
 
Some users have suggested using a regular webcam with a USB extension cable and plugging it into the USB port of the Samsung TV [^4^]. However, this may not work with all models of Samsung TVs or webcams, and you may need to adjust some settings on your TV or webcam. You should also check the compatibility of your webcam with your preferred video chat app.
 
Another option is to use a smartphone or tablet as a webcam and connect it to your Samsung TV via Wi-Fi or HDMI cable. You can use apps like DroidCam, iVCam, or EpocCam to turn your mobile device into a webcam and stream video to your TV. You may need to install some software on your PC or TV to make this work. You should also make sure that your mobile device has a good camera and microphone, and that your Wi-Fi connection is stable.
